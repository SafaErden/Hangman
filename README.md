## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

<h3 align="center"> In this project, I built the Guessing game by using ruby. The main goal is to put into practice the main concepts of Object Oriented Programming. Particularly, classes and access to their attributes.</h3>

- If you want to play it online, visit [this repl link](https://repl.it/@SafaErden/Hangman) to reach and play my Masterming game online.

<h2>How to start the game?</h2>

1- download this repository

2- unpack it (winrar recommended)

3- copy its address from your download path

4- open your terminal commandline (powershell in my case)

5- write "cd" and put the address of the game folder

6- now, to run the game, type 'ruby play.rb'

7- Have fun!

How to Play it...

1. When you run the game, the computer will choose a random word for you too guess.

2. At each step you will type a character.

3. If you find any character of the secret word, you will be requested to type a new char untill you guess the whole word.

4. If your guess is incorret, your remaining guesses will be decremented until you run out of the remaining guesses.

5. Have fun!
